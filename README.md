# nr-email-microservice

This Project is just starting. We are refactoring our NR Messaging Service Showcase application and creating a microservice from its backend so that other projects that would like to onboard to using the CMSG-Messaging-API can do so with as least effort as possible.   

This Microservice can be deployed as a container in your product to enable sending email, and checking the status

You need to contact NR.CommonServiceShowcase@gov.bc.ca to get an account for your application.

## Showcase Application
The microservice is currently implemented directly as the backend of the NR Messaging Service Showcase application.

COMING SOON: To see this microservice implemented by another application you can review https://github.com/bcgov/nr-messaging-service-showcase
