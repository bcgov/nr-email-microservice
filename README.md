# nr-email-microservice

The NR Email Microservice project is a result of refactoring the NR Messaging Service Showcase application.  We have created a microservice from its backend so that other projects can use the CMSG-Messaging-API with the least amount of effort as possible.   

This Microservice can be deployed as a container in your product to enable sending email, and checking the status.  Optionally, it can be protected with OpenID Connect and JWT.

You need to contact NR.CommonServiceShowcase@gov.bc.ca to get an account for your application.

## Showcase Application
The microservice is currently implemented directly as the backend of the [NR Messaging Service Showcase application](https://github.com/bcgov/nr-messaging-service-showcase).
