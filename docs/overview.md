## Summary

The Common Messaging Service (CMSG) is used to email users. The CMSG service is a REST web service that may be integrated into applications by developers. The Messaging service is not a user accessible service. The CMSG may only be invoked through an application.

### Capabilities

* Send email
* Tracks delivery status information and makes the status information available so that applications can respond to a failed delivery.
* Automated retry where a message notification has failed.
